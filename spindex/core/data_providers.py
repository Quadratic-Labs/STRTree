"""
Data containers for a spatially indexed collection of geometric shapes.

The module aim to be compatible with many type of data and to evaluate lazily
as much as possible. For example, :class:`GIShapes` data attribute can be
any container implementing a subset of the Python mapping API. These can be
dictionaries, pandas Series or pandas GeoSeries for example, but also an
iterator on these types.
